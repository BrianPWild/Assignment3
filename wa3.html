<h1 style="text-align:center">Reflections on $GME go brrr</h1>

<h2 style="text-align:left">The Issue</h2>
<p>&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp; Before the explosive increases seen in Gamestop's stock, it all started with Hertz. /rWallstreetBets had decide to practice a 'gamma squeeze' on Hertz's stock, while on the Gamestop stock, /rWallstreet bets had practiced a 'short squeeze'. The difference here is the harm created. In a gamma squeeze, a 'whale' (a large buyer, in this case /rWallstreetbets) buys a stock at a low price, then purchases short call options which forces the option-sellers to buy the shares to meet the call. The influx of purchasing causes the stock price to rise and the options expire, but the cost is absorbed by the 'whale' and the option-seller can then sell the shares at a profit (a win-win).</p>
<p>&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp; Now, the differentiation of the short squeeze from this of gamma squeeze is what has Wall street calling for regulation. Why? Because harm is committed. In the short squeeze, a 'whale' will buy a large amount of shares causing a stock price to go up, which then forces the short-sellers (in this case, hedge funds) to buy a stock at the elevated price, causing the stock's price to go even higher; thus developing into a viscious cycle.</p>
<p>&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp; The big problem with a short squeeze that develops is cost to the short sellers, which often leverage long-hold stocks such as AAPL, GOOGL, and XOM against the borrowed stock. When they can't cover the borrowed stock, the lender then sells the leveraged stock at whatever price, which then causes the market to develop a bearish engulfing (as evidenced by the heavy dips in the market while GME, AMC, BB saw huge increases). Thus, not only are the hedge funds losing money on the attempted covers, but also the lost leveraged stock.</p>

<h2 style="text-align:left">So What? F*** the Hedge Funds</h2>
<p>&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp; While the short squeeze began out of anger/frustration that hedge funds were attempting to short GME into the ground, there are further reaching implications as well. While some people made millions, and even billions, off the massive spike in GME, a vast majority lost indispensable income with its subsequent fall. Though the squeeze served as an economic representative of the French Revolution, it ended up turning into something more akin to the Communist Revolution in China, where initially the intentions were good, but when the dust settled it became apparent that only the Party would reap the rewards while everyday people became the unknowing victims of this method.</p>
<p>&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp; Knowing now that a sizeable number of people were financially harmed by this squeeze, should there be regulations or policies to control this practice? In short, (pun intended) no. Why not? Because interventionism is a failed endeavor. The market, when allowed to behave freely, is self-correcting. Price is determined by quality and value. In trying to regulate, only more instability would be created. Interventionism main failing is that it can only predict past failures. Following the Great Constriction (better known as the Great Depression) was caused by monetary contraction, where financial institutions attempt to control monetary economics. Following this, legislation was put in place to intervene from this happening again. Problem-solved? Of course not, otherwise there wouldn't have been numerous other depressions and recessions following this. Because, as above, interventionism is a hindsight method, it does not have the necessary foresight to prevent future, unknown risks.</p>
